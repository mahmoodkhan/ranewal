        <p class="lead">
            I started this blog as a way for myself to document some of the technical how-tos
            and guides that I have documented for myself for later use. However, it occurred
            to me that others may find it useful too if I make it public.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, I am also hoping that anyone who happens to read something here and finds
            it incorrect to please use the comment section to let me know so that I can update it
            for everyone else to benefit from. Likewise, if there is a better way (more efficient, concise, cleaner, more secure, etc)
            way of achieving the same result, please comment.
        </p>
